# Trident R2 Pin Mod
This mod replaces the bearings-over-screw-threads in the A/B mounts, X/Y joints, and front idlers with pins or shoulder screws.  


<br/>
<br/>

# Filament Preparations
As the design relies heavily on tight tolerances, no pre-scaled files are provided.  
Instead, first [calibrate your filament](https://github.com/ai03-2725/truss-3dp-shrinkage-util) - make sure pressure advance/flow dynamics/K-factor, flow rate, and shrinkage compensation are tuned for the filaments being used.  

# Fitment Testing
Next, print the provided pin fitment tester tool with the calibrated production print settings.  
Place the seams in the provided seam escapement teardrops for vertical holes (for example using the seam painter in OrcaSlicer) - this prevents the seams from unpredictably protruding into the holes and affecting pin fitment.  
![Seam position](images/seam-position.png)
Test the pins and screws being used to pick which hole diameter variant to print - the pins should not be loose, but also not be so tight as to deform or overly strain the printed part.  
The tester provides testing holes for both vertical holes (A/B/X/Y) and horizontal holes (front idlers).

# Printing the Production Parts
Pick the variants with the ideal hole size found in the previous step.  
Use the same settings as used earlier for the hole fitment test - make sure to place the seams in the escapement areas as necessary for vertical holes.  
Please note that the provided STLs have not been pre-processed in any way - make sure they are rotated for printing in the correct orientation as necessary.

# Front Idler
![Front idler pin mod](images/front-idler-pin-mod.png)

### Modified Parts
- `[a]_idler_carrier_a_x2`  
  Five different models are provided (Stock 5.20mm gap, narrower 5.15/5.10/5.05/5.00 gap).
- `[a]_idler_carrier_b_x2`  

### Unmodified parts
While only the above part has been modified, the rest of the front idler components have also been exported as STLs alongside without pre-scaling in case you wish to print all components with the same shrinkage compensation for a perfect fit.  
If using these STLs, please make sure their print orientation is correct - they have not been rotated or pre-processed in any way.  

### BOM Changes
- 1x M5x16 BHCS -> 1x 5x18mm pin (per idler)

<br/>
<br/>

# A/B Drives
![A/B drive pin mod](images/ab-drive-pin-mod.png)

### Modified Parts
- `a_stepper_upper`
- `a_stepper_lower`
- `b_stepper_upper`
- `b_stepper_lower`  
  For the above four parts, five different models are provided (5.10/5.15/5.20/5.25/5.30 holes for the shoulder screw).

### BOM Changes
- 2x M5x30 BHCS -> 2x 5x30mm pin (per each drive)
- No longer need 2x M5 heat-set inserts (per each drive)

<br/>
<br/>

# X/Y Joints
![X/Y joint shoulder screw mod](images/xy-shoulder-screw-mod.png)
This modification uses shoulder screws instead of pins to maintain the necessary force pulling the upper and lower portions together instead of putting all of the strain on just two M3 screws.  

### Modified parts
- `xy_left_upper`
- `xy_left_lower`
- `xy_right_upper`
- `xy_right_lower`  
  For the above four parts, five different models are provided (5.10/5.15/5.20/5.25/5.30 holes for the shoulder screw).
- `[a]_xy_left`
- `[a]_xy_right`
- `[a]_xy_right_D2F`  
  The only change to these three parts is added clearance cutouts for the shoulder screw protrusion and M4 nuts.

### BOM Changes
- 2x M5x30 BHCS -> 2x 5x35mm+M4 shoulder screw (per each drive)
- 2x M5 heat-set inserts -> 2x M4 hex nuts (per each drive)

Note: I've also made a [simplified X/Y joint](../Trident%20R2%20Simplified%20XY%20Joints/) mod which uses the same shoulder screws.

# Hardware Specs
- The pins should be *maximum* 5.00mm diameter - pins which deviate to larger diameters will not fit through the bearings/idlers.  
  - Possible sources: [This](<https://aliexpress.com/item/33003800129.html>) (I've used this listing for pin modding in the past; it works albeit too tight of a fit sometimes), [this](<https://aliexpress.com/item/1005005710466043.html>), any other known source for pin mod pins
- The shoulder screws used in the X/Y joint design should be as follows:
  - Column diameter 5mm (similarly to the pins, make sure tolerances guarantee 5.00mm max), length 35mm
  - Threaded portion M4, length anywhere from 7mm to 8mm
